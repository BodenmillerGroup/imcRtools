\title{Performs perturbations to test if two cell-types interact more or 
less frequently than random.}
\usage{
neighborhoodPermTest(
  object,
  group_by,
  label,
  colPairName,
  method = c("classic", "histocat", "patch"),
  patch_size = NULL,
  iter = 1000,
  p_threshold = 0.01,
  BBPARAM = SerialParam()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{SingleCellExperiment} or \code{SpatialExperiment}
object .}

\item{group_by}{a single character indicating the \code{colData(object)}
entry by which interactions are grouped. This is usually the image ID or
patient ID.}

\item{label}{single character specifying the \code{colData(object)} entry
which stores the cell labels. These can be cell-types labels or other m
metadata.}

\item{colPairName}{single character indicating the \code{colPair(object)}
entry containing cell-cell interactions in form of an edge list.}

\item{method}{which cell-cell interaction counting method to use 
(see details)}

\item{patch_size}{if \code{method = "patch"}, a single numeric specifying
the minimum number of neighbors of the same type to be considered a patch
(see details)}

\item{iter}{single numeric specifying the number of permutations to perform}

\item{p_threshold}{single numeric indicating the empirical p-value 
threshold at which interactions are considered to be significantly 
enriched or depleted per group.}

\item{BBPARAM}{parameters for parallelized processing.}
}
\value{
a DataFrame containing one row per \code{group_by} entry and unique
label entry combination (\code{from_label}, \code{to_label}). The object
contains following entries:

\describe{
\item{ct}{stores the interaction count as described in the details}   
\item{p_gt}{stores the fraction of perturbations equal or greater than \code{ct}}  
\item{p_lt}{stores the fraction of perturbations equal or less than \code{ct}}  
\item{interaction}{is there the tendency for a positive interaction between  
\code{from_label} and \code{to_label}? Is \code{p_lt} greater than \code{p_gt}?}  
\item{p}{the smaller value of \code{p_gt} and \code{p_lt}.}  
\item{sig}{is \code{p} smaller than \code{p_threshold}?}  
\item{sigval}{Combination of \code{interaction} and \code{sig}.
   -1: \code{interaction == FALSE} and \code{sig == TRUE}  
    0: \code{sig == FALSE}  
    1: \code{interaction == TRUE} and \code{sig == TRUE}}  
}

\code{NA} is returned if a certain label is not present in this grouping level.
}
\description{
Cell-cell interactions are summarized in different ways and
the resulting count is compared to a distribution of counts arising 
from random permutations.

\section{Counting and summarizing cell-cell interactions}{

In principle, the \code{summarizeNeighborhood} function counts the number
of edges (interactions) between each set of unique entries in 
\code{colData(object)[[label]]}. Simplified, it counts for each cell of
type A the number of neighbors of type B.

This count can be averaged within each unique entry 
\code{colData(object)[[group_by]]} in three different ways:

1. \code{method = "classic"}: The count is divided by the total number of 
cells of type A. The final count can be interpreted as "How many neighbors 
of type B does a cell of type A have on average?" 

2. \code{method = "classic"}: The count is divided by the number of cells
of type A that have at least one neighbor of type B. The final count can be 
interpreted as "How many many neighbors of type B has a cell of type A on 
average, given it has at least one neighbor of type B?"

3. \code{method = "patch"}: For each cell, the count is binarized to 0 
(less than \code{patch_size} neighbors of type B) or 1 (more or equal to 
\code{patch_size} neighbors of type B). The binarized counts are averaged 
across all cells of type A. The final count can be interpreted as "What 
fraction of cells of type A have at least a given number of neighbors of 
type B?"
