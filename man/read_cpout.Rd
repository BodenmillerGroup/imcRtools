\arguments{
\item{path}{full path to the CellProfiler output folder.}

\item{object_file}{single character indicating the file name storing the
object/cell-specific intensities and metadata.}

\item{image_file}{single character indicating the file name storing meta data
per image (can be \code{NULL}).}

\item{panel_file}{single character indicating the file name storing the panel
information (can be \code{NULL}).}

\item{graph_file}{single character indicating the file name storing the
object/cell interaction information (can be \code{NULL}).}

\item{object_feature_file}{single character indicating the file name storing
object/cell feature information.}

\item{intensities}{single character indicating which column entries of the
\code{object_file} contain the intensity features of interest. See details.}

\item{extract_imgid_from}{single character indicating which column entries of
the \code{object_file} and \code{image_file} contain the image integer ID.}

\item{extract_cellid_from}{single character indicating which column entry
of the \code{object_file} contains the object/cell integer ID.}

\item{extract_coords_from}{character vector indicating which column entries
of the \code{object_file} contain the x and y location of the
objects/cells.}

object/cell specific metadata to extract from the \code{object_file}.}

\item{extract_imagemetadata_from}{character vector indicating which
additional image specific metadata to extract from the \code{image_file}.

\description{
Reader function to generate a
\code{\linkS4class{SpatialExperiment}} or
\code{\linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}} object from single-cell data
obtained by the 
\href{https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline}{ImcSegmentationPipeline}
pipeline.
}
\section{The returned data container}{

In the case of both containers \code{x}, intensity features (as selected
by the \code{intensities} parameter) are stored in the \code{counts(x)} slot.
Cell metadata (e.g morphological features) are stored in the
\code{colData(x)} slot. The interaction graphs are stored as
\code{\link[S4Vectors]{SelfHits}} object in the 
\code{colPair(x, "neighborhood")} slot.

Intensity features are extracted via partial string matching. Internally, the 
\code{read_cpout} function checks if per channel a single intensity feature
is read in (by checking the \code{_cXY} ending where \code{XY} is the 
channel number).

In the case of a returned \code{SpatialExperiment} object, the cell 
coordinates are stored in the \code{spatialCoords(x)} slot.

In the case of a returned \code{SingleCellExperiment} object, the cell 
coordinates are stored in the \code{colData(x)} slot named as \code{Pos_X}
and \code{Pos_Y}.
